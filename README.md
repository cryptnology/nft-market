# NFT Market

A DApp where you can mint your own NFTs, sell that NFT, cancel an unwanted NFT, re-instate a cancelled NFT or buy someone else's NFT that they placed on the open marketplace. You can also interact with the DApp on both the Rinkeby or Polygon (Mumbai) test networks.

## Demo

## Usage

Please visit [NFT Market](https://bgfvc-ayaaa-aaaad-qaz5q-cai.ic.fleek.co/) and have your MetaMask wallet connected to the Rinkeby or Polygon (Mumbai) test network.
